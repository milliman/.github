Milliman serves the full spectrum of business, financial, government, union, education, and nonprofit organizations. In addition to our consulting actuaries, Milliman's body of professionals includes numerous other specialists, ranging from clinicians to economists.

Despite our impressive growth over the past six decades, we still operate according to the guiding principles of our founders, Wendell Milliman and Stuart Robertson. We retain their rigorous standards of professional excellence, peer review and objectivity. We remain committed to developing innovative tools and products and providing expert solutions. And we continue to earn our clients’ trust by keeping our focus fixed on their business objectives.

## Open-source Contributions

Milliman encourages its developers to be good citizens of the open-source community. This means developers are encouraged to contribute back to projects they use in a variety of ways (e.g. code, issues, documentation). In making these contributions, developers are acting as individuals, and not on Milliman's behalf. Their contributions are not a work product of Milliman and do not imply that Milliman agrees to a given project's contribution guidelines.
